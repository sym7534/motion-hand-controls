make closed % be a relative distance, not absolute distance - accounts for distance to camera

limit servo movement ? or track servo movement to get a min/max

remake hand_classifier.py to return distance based on fingertip <-> MCP joint and then rotate servos based on that
- nonlinear? idk like depends on how your fingers bend

define base position for servos -> reset to base position every time it starts
